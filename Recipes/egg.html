        <ul>
            <strong>Ingredients</strong>
            <li>Eggs</li>
            <li>herbs of any choice</li>
            <li>Vegetable oil</li>
            <li>Onion</li>
            <li>Capsicum (can ignore too)</li>
            <li>Garlic cloves </li>
            <li>Red chilli</li>
            <li>Tomatoes</li>
            <li>Some more spices</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <strong>Steps</strong>
            <li>Crack the eggs and whisk to combine. Adding cilantro and salt here helps evenly distribute them.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a nonstick pan. Sauté the onions to soften and bring out their natural sweetness. A bit of crisp around the edges is lovely, but we’re not browning them like we would for a curry.</li>
            <li>Add garlic and green chili pepper to take the bite out and soften. I also add the remaining salt here to add flavor to the plentiful onions.</li>
            <li>Reduce the heat and cook out the rawness (or kachapan) from spices. Add the tomato and sauté for a minute to soften but still keep its freshness.</li>
            <li>Now you’ll pour in the eggs. Stir the eggs constantly, just until they’re cooked and no longer custardy or slimy.</li>
            <li>Turn off the heat when they’re cooked but still soft.</li>
            <li>Garnish with more cilantro if you’d like. Devour immediately!</li>

        </ol>
